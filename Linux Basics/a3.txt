Questions: 
1. Write a command that will find all .html files on a computer that are 12 bytes in size, owned by "jake". 
   * You can make an example file by putting the contents "is this html" into a file and saving it as a .html file. 
   * However, getting the owner to be named Jake would require you to create a new user on your system and that is a bit of work
   * I recommend you just write one that will find ones owned by you, and then for your answer, submit the "Jake" version.
2. Write a command that finds any "hidden" (starts with . ) file in your user home folder.
