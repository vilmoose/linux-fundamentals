Linux Basics:

Hacker Ethic: 
6 beliefs:
1. Access to computers and anything which might teach you something about the way of the world works should be unlimited and total. Always yield to the Hands-On Imperative.
2. All information should be free.
3. Mistrust authority, promote decantralization.
4. Hackers should be judged by their hacking, not bogus criteria such as degrees, race, age, or position.
5. You can create art and beauty on a computer. The concept of "hack value" is doing something that is worth doing because fo "playful cleverness" required.
6. Computers can change your life for the better.

Man Pages:
a resource used to provide information about commands, their flags, and what they do. This is done via:
"man [name of command]"
For information about man pages use command :'man man'

NETWORKING FUNDAMENTALS
Networking
"ip addr" shows ip address of the device youre on.
localhost (127.0.0.1) is a non routable ip address for internal purposes.

Routing
"traceroute" traces the route from localhost to provided network host.
Network Address Translation (NAT) is a method of mapping one IP address to another by modifying packets while they are in transit.
NAT allows connections out and responses back but does not allow connections in.
VM's can switch between NAT'd IP address and a Bridged IP address. Bridged IP addresses are IP addresses assigned by your local router which will be NAT'd by the router when you connect out. 
NAT'd IP addresses are IP addresses assigned by your virtualization software, which puts that box behind a NAT (means if you are NAT'd another local computer will not be able to connect to you, but if youre bridged your IP address will be routable).

Netcat (nc)
A troubleshooting tool. Most common use is that you can send and recieve arbitrary data across a network.
-To make a listening port use command "nc -lp ####" where #### is the number of the port you want to listen on.
-Using echo "message" | nc localhost ####" you can send echos to the port specified by ####

Exercise: on two terminals (a server and client) send a file and print it out.
Solution: server: nc -lp 1337
	  client: cat test.txt | nc localhost 1337
Solution extra: to append lines to the file and then send it:
echo "adding text" > test.txt | cat test.txt | nc localhost 1337
This adds the phrase "adding text" to the end of test.txt, sends it to server, and prints it.

Exercise: with a friend, connect to their box
Solution: get ip addresses and make sure both boxes are on the same network, and change ip to bridged.

-curl is a command that quickly grabs resources of a provided url.
for an image download: "curl -o imagename.png url"

-netstat is a command used to print network connections, routing tables, interface statistics, masquerade connections, and multicast memberships.

-lsof is a command used to list open files

Telnet: old-fashioned protocol which provides nice an easy shell accss to anyone running a telnet server (usually unauthenticated - wohoo). for star wars ep4: "telnet towel.blinkenlights.nl"

SSH (Secure SHell)
It is a networking protocol that allows encrypted access to remote computers. How it works: a remote computer (SSH server) listens for incoming connections, while the local computer sends a request via SSH protocl to log in to the server. If the password is correct, server will create a shell on the remote computer and pass the stream from that shell to the client. This way the client who logged on via SSH is able to have access to the remote computer in an ecnrypted manner. To SSH you can either use a password or a key.

Text-Fu
Useful Commands: 
-head: prints top few lines of larger file
-tail: prints last few lines of larger file
-less: brings you to top of file and allows you to scroll or search through it
-reset: if you break the terminal
-clear: clears printed text
-cut: remove sections from each line. 
	-d: sets a delimiter (tells us what we will base the line 	split on). ex if -d " " then we separate based on spaces
	-f: describes which columns we want, numbered from the 	delimiter
	-c: gives character at specified value(s)
	-b: gives character at specified byte
-awk: an interpreter for AWK programming language. Used for manipulation of data files, text retrieval and processing, and prototyping and experimenting with algorithms. it assumes the delimiter is a space.
	ex: cat textfile | awk {print $1" "$2" "$3} 
	this prints the first three words separated by spaces in the 	file textfile.
-sed: stream editor; used to perform basic text transformations on an input stream.
-tr: translate, squeeze, and/or delete characters from stdin, writing to stdout. 
	ex: $ cat animals |  awk '{print $1" "$2" "$3}' | tr 'd' 'a'
	changes the letters d to a in specified words given by awk
	ex2: cat animals |  awk '{print $1" "$2" "$3}' | tr 'do' 	'pi'
	changes the letters do to pi in specified words given by awk
-grep (global regular expression print): searches the name input files for lines containing a match to the given pattern. By default grep prints the matching lines highlighting the specified pattern.

Text editors
-gedit: a text editor with GUI, normal mouse use, copy/paste, similar to notepad on windows.
-nano: super basic in terminal editor, good for minimal use.
-vi/vim: builtin editor in most linux systems (vim is newer version of vi but they do basically the same thing)
-emacs: another editor

Text editors like vi/vim/emacs are special because of their extensibility and keyboard based shortcuts. This allows for programmers to speed up navigatio of a code base and type faster.

grep:
Stands for Global Regular Expression Print.
-doing $ cat animals | grep "dog" is the same as $ grep "dog" animals
-use * (known as wildcard) to search an entire directory.
-the flag -l is used when you only want to know which files in a directory have the target word
-the flag -n is used when you want to know the file name and line number
-the flag -v is used when you only want to see the lines in the file which dont have the term you are greping for

Regex (Regular Expression): a technical way to define a particular search pattern, and grep is built around them. Always check which standard is being compiled with and modify your regex accordingly.
-Alternate definition: are strings formatted using a special pattern and notation that allow you to describe and parse text. 
-Metacharacters:
-"^"(caret) and "$":represent the start and end of a line of text, respectively. When used together they allow you to match specific expression on a lin by itself. Ex: ^word$ would find only lines that contain "word".
-"[]":known as character class, they let you match any of one several characters. If you use [^...] it negates the list, so it returns matches that aren't listed. Ex: gr[ea]y find matches for either the word gray or grey or gr[^iu]y returns matches that have any letters that are not i or u in between gr and y.
-"-": indicates a range of characters. It is only a metacharacter within a character class, else it it is simply a dash. Ex: instead of [12345] we can write [1-5].
-".": shorthand for a character class that matches any character. Only a metacharacter within a character class, else it is simply a dot.
-"|" (pipe): means or. Allows you to combine multiple expressions into a single expression that matches any of the individual ones. The subexpressions are known as alternatives. Ex: Mike|Michael or you can shorten it: Mi(ke|chael).
-"?": means optional. It is placed after a character that is allowed but not required. Ex: colou?r means that the letter u is optional in the word.
-"+" and "*": affect the number of times the preceding character can appear in the expression. '+' matches one or more of the immediately preceding item and '*' matches any number of the preceding item including 0. Ex: go+al matches any expression such as goal, goooal, goooooooal, but gal.
-"{}": Known as min, max, it allows you to specify the number of times a particular item can match by providing your own minimum and maximum. Ex: go{1,5}al would only allow up to goooooal.
-"\": used to escape metacharacyer that have special meaning so you can match themin patterns. Ex: to match ? or \ characters you do '\?' or '\\'. 
-"()": most tools will allow you to capture a particular subset of an expression with parenthesis. Ex: http://([^/]+) matches any character except for '/' one or more times after the exprssion 'http//'
Some examples:
    gr[ae]y = contains {gray, grey}
    b[aeiou]bble = contains {babble, bebble, bibble, bobble, bubble}
    [b-chm-pP]at|ot = contains {bat, cat, hat, mat, nat, oat, pat, Pat, ot}
    z{3,6} = contains {zzz, zzzz, zzzzz, zzzzzz}
    z{3,} = contains {zzz, zzzz, zzzzz, ...}
    \d = contains {0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9}
    \d+(.\d\d)? = contains a positive integer or a floating point number with    	exactly two characters after the decimal point.
    1\d{10} = contains an 11-digit string starting with a 1
    ^dog = begins with "dog"
    dog$ = ends with "dog"
    ^dog$ = is exactly "dog"

find: 
Only deals with file information, not file content.
-"-name" flag finds all files in given directory with that name
-"-type f -name" finds all files in given directory with the type specified
-"-perm" finds all files in given directory with permission specified
-" / " searches from root
-"-user" finds all files owned by specified user
-"-size" finds all files with specified size
-"mtime" finds all files modified in the specified time (in days)

Useful tips (Ubuntu):
-Use Tab key to autocomplete when writing out files
-'cd ~' takes you to home and 'cd -' takes you back to previous directory
-'history' lets you look at most recent command history, combined with grep you can pup the two together and search your most recent commands
-for long commands use the home and end keys or ctrl-a and ctrl-e to zoom to front and back
-'!!' reruns previous command using sudo. '!' reruns the most recent of a specific command (ex: !ls reruns last ls used)
-ctrl-c to kill a process. ctr-x to standby
-ctrl-shift-t for a new terminal tab, ctrl-shift-n for new terminal window.
