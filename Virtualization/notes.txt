Virtualization

"echo $XDG_CURRENT_DESKTOP" -> To check if you are in a Gnome-based environment.
"wget -O ~/desired_file_location "link" "-> downloads image from web into desired file directory 
"gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.background picture-uri file:///home/vf/downloads/image.jpg" -> sets the background to picture given via the file location. NOTE: picture-uri specifies path to take to picture location, needs to be in format: "file:///path"

Linux Privileges

Users only have limited ability to access files (OS and other user files are locked).
"sudo" stands for substitute user do, is used to escalate priviliges up to the level of the username specified in the command. It defaults to admin access (known as 'root' on linux). Users with root access can read, write, and modify anything on the system. When you use sudo with a command you will be asked for the root password and will only execute the command if the pw is correct.

Principle of Least Privilege: log in as normal user, and only use root privileges when we need to.


Packages

Packages are what Linux OS use to distribute and maintain software. They ae custome file formats that usually contain an archive of compressed files that are used to install as well describe how to install and what the dependancies are.

Dependancies are a list of requirements needed by a software to run.
On Ubuntu, the package management system is called DPKG (Debian package). 'apt' and 'apt-get' are front ends for the DPKG system, and allow command line access to update and install new packages.
Ubuntu can also install .deb files via system tools (command line or gui).


"sudo apt-get update" ->updates all locations and dependancies for the repositories saved on the computer.

"sudo apt-get upgrade" -> checks list of updated packages and downloads and upgrades any that need to be updated.

"sudo apt-get install foobar" -> installs most recent version of specified program.

You can download Brave or Chrome via sudo and using a .deb file
